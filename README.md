# Zomato-Power-BI-Data-Project
The primary goal of this project is to develop an interactive dashboard to analyze Zomatoâ€™s extensive data set. This includes examining the average dining rate for two, identifying cities with the most restaurants under Zomato, and evaluating average restaurant ratings.

This project serves as a powerful tool for Zomato to assess its performance and strategize for future growth.
